   "Text": "Speed tests mean very little with regards to streaming and your choice of bitrate. They measure your raw upload speed to a server that's near you (likely run by your local ISP), instead of your stable upload speed to a streaming server. Your stable speed will determine the bitrate you can comfortably stream at.\nThe stable speed can be estimated as roughly 70-75% of the speed test result in a lot of cases, however this is by no means a perfect estimate. In reality, it may end up being much worse if there's problems between your ISP and the streaming service."
