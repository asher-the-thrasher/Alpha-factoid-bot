| amfdrivers              | Due to an increase in crash reports usually from users with old or even ancient (>1 year out of date) drivers, the decision was made to no longer load the plugin on those systems. This also reduced the amount of code necessary to maintain as backwards compatibility is only necessary for the UI instead of both the UI and the encoder. The recommended version is 19.9.2 or newer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| avast                   | The Avast/AVG antivirus' Game Mode is known to cause issues with OBS. Having it enabled will essentially render OBS inoperable.

| bestsettings            | There are no "best settings." Please understand that every setup, for every use case, will be very different. Any guides or videos that claim otherwise are misinforming. Your best option is to start with a base and adjust as necessary. Test, test, and test again. We are happy to offer suggestions for any issues you may be having, but we will not give you a list of settings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| camav                   | Many modern antivirus programs have added in and automatically enabled webcam protection features that block applications such as OBS from being able to access webcams and capture cards. Check that your antivirus program does not have a webcam/video device blocking feature, and if it does, you will need to add OBS as an exception.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| chromeos                | OBS will not be developed for ChromeOS. The operating system has too many limits in place that prevent OBS from being able to do what it needs to do, and more often than not, Chromebook hardware is too weak to render and encode live video. The Linux Beta for ChromeOS does not change this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Additionally, it's also a DirectX 12 game, which means it can have issues with frame pacing.<br>To minimize the game's impact on OBS performance, limit the game to a stable frame rate (e.g. 60 FPS) and consider turning down your graphics quality settings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| dpi                     | Due to issues with how Qt handles high-DPI display scaling, you may encounter some oddities in the OBS Studio UI when using DPI scaling. As a workaround, you can disabled DPI scaling for OBS:<br>Close OBS Studio.<br>Find your OBS Studio shortcut, either on your desktop or in your start menu (Right click -> Open file location).<br>Right click on it and select "Properties".<br>Go to the "Compatibility tab".<br>Click "Change high DPI settings".<br>Tick "Override high DPI scaling behavior".<br>In the dropdown, change it to "System (Enhanced)".<br>Click OK to exit out of the scaling settings.<br>Click OK to save the new properties.<br>Launch OBS Studio as you normally would.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| dslr                    | DSLR cameras and camcorders are not built to be webcams. Preview functions via USB can't be used in OBS. To get a clean video and audio feed from a DSLR or camcorder, you need a HDMI capture card. Lastly, note that a high quality webcam is often cheaper than a capture card.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| dx12                    | There is a known issue when using game capture to capture DirectX 12 games where frames may be returned out of order, causing a stuttering effect. We are working on ways to deal with the issue, but it will be some time before a proper fix or workaround is available. For the time being, the best solution would be to lock your game to 60FPS and change the Hook Rate setting in your game capture source to "Fastest". Otherwise, consider trying display capture instead of game capture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

While editing features would be nice, the main focus on development in OBS right now is on improving OBS's streaming and recording features, and we're happy to leave the editing step for other, more specialized programs to handle.

| elgatomac               | Elgato doesn't provide macOS drivers for the HD, HD60, or HD60 S that work with OBS, so they can't be added as a Video Capture device. For these cards you'll have to capture Elgato's software running in fullscreen via Window Capture.<br>However, Elgato now has OBS Link as a new NDI-based workaround tool for the HD 60 S to add OBS compatibility.<br>For native macOS support via UVC, please consider the Elgato Cam Link or HD60 S+ ("plus").                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| fpslimit                | Running a game without vertical sync or a frame rate limiter will frequently cause performance issues (both your game and OBS) because your GPU will be maxed out. Enable vsync or set a reasonable frame rate limit that your GPU can handle without hitting 100% usage. If that's not enough you may also need to turn down some of the video quality options in the game.<br>For more technical details and alternate fixes, see our guide: https://obsproject.com/wiki/GPU-overload-issues                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| fullscreen              | If a game is set to run in full-screen mode, when you alt+tab out the game, it will stop rendering. This means that you will not see the game in OBS while it is minimized. Either make a test recording and check it to verify the capture worked properly, or move OBS to a second monitor if you have one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| hfr                     | To record framerates higher than 60fps, you will need very powerful hardware (SSD, high-end GPU, significant CPU overhead, fast RAM) in order to accomplish it. There are no simple instructions that will make it work. It is recommended that you stay at or under 120fps when using OBS, and we may be unable to provide support for higher framerates if your hardware cannot handle it. Be prepared for hours of trial and error on your own.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| manualcam               | If your video capture device is not displaying video in OBS, try setting the resolution and FPS to something known that the device supports. Go to the Video Capture Device properties, change Resolution/FPS Type from Device Default to Custom, and then set the options accordingly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| programcapture          | Unfortunately, it is impossible to capture only a single program's audio in Windows due to limitations of the Windows API. Windows only makes it possible to capture all audio from a specific device.

| refresh                 | Due to Windows' limitations, using multiple displays with different refresh rates will cause performance issues in hardware-accelerated applications, including OBS. You can fix this by setting all displays to the same refresh rate. An easier solution may be to simply use monitors that all have the same refresh rate.<br>This problem is fixed in the Windows 10 May 2020 Update, which has started rolling out to users as of May 27, 2020.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| simple                  | Advanced output mode, while allowing for more fine-tuning of options, does not automatically mean that your stream or recording will have better quality. Often, it can result in lower quality, because it can allow changes to settings that really shouldn't be changed. In most cases, Simple output mode is the best option to get the most out of OBS.<br>To change back to Simple output mode:<br>1) Go to Settings > Output in OBS.<br>2) Change "Output Mode" from "Advanced" to "Simple".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| speedtest               | Speed tests mean very little with regards to streaming and your choice of bitrate. They measure your raw upload speed to a server that's near you (likely run by your local ISP), instead of your stable upload speed to a streaming server. Your stable speed will determine the bitrate you can comfortably stream at.<br>The stable speed can be estimated as roughly 70-75% of the speed test result in a lot of cases, however this is by no means a perfect estimate. In reality, it may end up being much worse if there's problems between your ISP and the streaming service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

This can be found by searching for Windows Update in the Start Menu, or in the Control Panel.<br>2) Install any available updates.<br>3) Restart your PC to finish installing updates.<br>4) Repeat steps 1-3 until there are absolutely 0 updates remaining.<br>Once Windows is fully up to date, try installing OBS again. If that doesn't work, install the UCRT manually: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3118401/update-for-universal-c-runtime-in-windows                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| x264presets             | When streaming, you can set the x264 preset to a slower sounding value for increased quality, at the cost of increased CPU usage. It is recommended to leave this value on veryfast, as there are significant diminishing returns to setting it lower.

| yellowborder            | When using a Window Capture source with the Windows Graphics Capture (WGC) method, or a Display Capture source with the Windows 10 1903+ method, you will have a yellow border surrounding the portion of the screen being captured. Unfortunately, this border cannot currently be removed, as the Windows SDK does not allow it. You can try using another capture method in the source properties, but it's possible this will instead produce a black screen.

| youtubebitrate          | You can find YouTube's recommended bitrates for different resolutions here: https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2853702?hl=en<br>Keep in mind that unlike Twitch, YouTube re-encodes your original stream resolution, so you may need a higher bitrate to match the quality you'd normally see. Aim for the higher values in the ranges suggested by YouTube.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| grow                    | Hi, <br><br>Since Twitch has horrible discoverability, you're going to find it very hard to grow from streaming alone. You need to be making content on other, more discoverable platforms and funnel those viewers to Twitch. <br>Platforms like YouTube (YT, FB, TikTok, etc) help grow your brand and create an interest in you and/or your content hanging out with you in a live stream. <br><br>Live interaction is Twitch's strength, so you'd need to see the strengths and weaknesses of each platform, and use them accordingly. <br><br>_Here are some Alpha Gaming Vids to watch if you haven't already:_<br>- 25 Twitch Tips in 10 mins: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si7VS8dVSZA <br>- Top 5 Streaming Mistakes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tjJpUkGGBw                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| bt                      | If your audio is muting when you launch OBS, and you're using a Bluetooth headset, it's caused by the underlying design of Bluetooth.
